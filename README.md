# N. Kostin's Bootstrapping Scripts (inspired by LARBS)

## Installation:

Run the following commands as a root user:

```
curl -LO nkostin.neocities.org/boot.sh
sh boot.sh
```

## What does this script do?

This is a bootstrapping script (inspired by LARBS) that is meant to be run after a minimal installation of Artix (or Arch) linux. It installs less bloatware (lol) than LARBS does.
